* **List of ignored numbers** – list of numbers which will be ignored. Popup window will not be displayed.
* **Permitted Entities** – entities that will be displayed in popup window and will be used to identify a caller by his phone number.
* **Hide a Lead** – Hide a Lead in a call popup when Account / Contact are available.

**Step 2.** Setup a cron job (scheduled task) to handle Asterisk events (incoming/outgoing calls, hangup, etc.). It is very important to set it up to run every minute. The line that needs to be added is displayed in the right section of your Asterisk settings. For linux-based OS, it looks like:
**\* \* \* \* \* /usr/bin/php -f /var/www/espocrm/voip.php Asterisk > /dev/null 2>&1**

### How to setup Asterisk Integration for users

Each user who wants to use Asterisk integration, should setup his access in the User’s Profile, under “VoIP Settings”. Usually, it’s the SIP credentials. Also, the user can change some VoIP settings on this window.
