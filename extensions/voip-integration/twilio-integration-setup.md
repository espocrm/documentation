# Twilio Integration Setup

VoIP Integration extension allows EspoCRM to integrate with an Asterisk server through Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI), Twilio service and Starface server. For more details about the features, please click [here](https://www.espocrm.com/features/voip-integration/).

There are two ways in which you can set up Twillio integration:

1. **Call forwarding**. An incoming call from a Twilio number is forwarded to the user’s primary phone number. For outgoing calls EspoCRM creates a connection between the user’s primary phone number and the number called through Twilio service. For more details about how you will be charged for these calls, click here: https://support.twilio.com/…for-Call-Forwarding-with-Twilio.
2. **Twillio SIP Trunk**. A SIP trunk is a virtual version of a phone line, that isn’t physically connected to a phone company and uses intranet and internal communication systems to access the outside phone lines. More detailed information about Twilio SIP Trunking can be found via the link: https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/api/sip-interface.
