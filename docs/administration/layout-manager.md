## Different layouts for teams & portals

*Layout Sets* provide the ability to have different layouts for teams & portals.

An admin can create a Layout Set record where they will define specific layouts that will differ from standard ones (which are defined in the Entity Manager). Layout sets are available at Administration > Layout Sets.

A Team and Portal have the *Layout Set* link fields.

For internal users (*regular* & *admin*), a Layout Set is applied through the *Default Team* (User > Default Team > Layout Set). The Team should have the Layout Set specified. That team should be set as a *Default Team* for the User.

For *portal* users, the Layout Set is applied through the *Portal* record.

A Layout Set can also be specified for a specific User in the *Layout Set* field. Only *regular* and *admin* users have this field available. 

!!! note

    You need to clear cache (Administration > Clear Cache) after configuring layout sets.

## Custom list layouts

*As of v8.0.*

An admin can create custom list layouts. These layouts can then be selected for specific relationship panels (at Administration > Entity Manager > {Entity Type} > Relationships).
