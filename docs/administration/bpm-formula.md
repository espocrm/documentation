# BPM Formula Functions

The [BPM tool](bpm.md) provides additional formula functions.

Formula script can be utilized in conditions, script tasks, various task actions. Some functions can be used in a workflow (broadcastSignal, startProcess).

* [bpm\targetEntity\attribute](##bpmtargetentityattribute)
* [bpm\createdEntity\attribute](#bpmcreatedentityattribute)
* [bpm\processEntity\attribute](#bpmprocessentityattribute)
* [bpm\startProcess](#bpmstartprocess)
* [bpm\broadcastSignal](#bpmbroadcastsignal)
* [bpm\caughtErrorCode](#bpmcaughterrorcode)
* [bpm\caughtErrorMessage](#bpmcaughterrormessage)

### bpm\targetEntity\attribute

`bpm\targetEntity\attribute(ATTRIBUTE)`

Fetches an attribute value of a target record.

### bpm\createdEntity\attribute

`bpm\createdEntity\attribute(ALIAS_ID, ATTRIBUTE)`

Fetches an attribute value of a record created within a process. 

Available records:

* records created within *Task* activities;
* user tasks;
* sent messages.


ALIAS_ID can be obtained:

* from the detail view of a *Task* that has an action that creates a record;
* from the detail view of a *User Task* (ID field);
* from the detail view of a *Send Message Task* (ID field).

!!! example

    ```
    $resolutionNote = bpm\createdEntity\attribute('e6cmwnd894', 'resolutionNote');
    ```

### bpm\processEntity\attribute

`bpm\processEntity\attribute(ATTRIBUTE)`

Fetches an attribute value of a process record.

### bpm\startProcess

`bpm\startProcess(FLOWCHART_ID, TARGET_TYPE, TARGET_ID, [ELEMENT_ID])`

Starts a process.

!!! example

    `bpm\startProcess('flowchart-id', 'Account', 'account-id');`

### bpm\broadcastSignal

* `bpm\broadcastSignal(SIGNAL_NAME)` – broadcast a regular signal
* `bpm\broadcastSignal(SIGNAL_NAME, ENTITY_TYPE, ENTITY_ID)` – broadcast an object signal

It can be useful to broadcast a custom signal from a workflow rule and then catch it inside a running process. A workflow rule will perform some condition checking and only after than will broadcast a signal.


!!! example "Example, regular signal"

    ```
    $signalName = string\concatenate(
        'notePostedInCaseBySupportManager.',
        entity\attribute('id')
    );

    bpm\broadcastSignal($signalName);
    ```

    Then it will be possible to catch the signal in a BPM process by listening to the signal `notePostedInCaseBySupportManager.{$id}`.

!!! example "Example, object signal"

    Workflow on Quote Item broadcasts a signal when amount is changed.

    ```
    bpm\broadcastSignal('@quoteItemIsChanged', 'Quote', entity\attribute('quoteId'));
    ```

    Then it will be possible to catch the signal by a workflow. It can be useful for situations when you need to recalculate something when a related record is changed.
    
    
### bpm\caughtErrorCode

*As of v2.14.*

Returns the code of a caught error. Error codes are of the string type. Can be used after a catching Error Event.


### bpm\caughtErrorMessage

*As of v2.14.*

Returns the message of a caught exception. Can be used after a catching Error Event.
