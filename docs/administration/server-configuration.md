* with PHP version 7.2 and later
* MySQL 5.7 (and later), or MariaDB 10.1 (and later)

## Recommendations & requirements

### PHP requirements

EspoCRM requires PHP 7.2 or later, with the following extensions:

* [pdo](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) – for database access;
* [json](http://php.net/manual/en/book.json.php);
* [gd](http://php.net/manual/en/book.image.php) – to manipulate images;
* [openssl](http://php.net/manual/en/book.openssl.php) – to ensure the highest protection;
* [zip](http://php.net/manual/en/book.zip.php) – to be able to upgrade EspoCRM and install extensions;
* [mbstring](http://php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php);
* [iconv](http://php.net/manual/en/book.iconv.php);
* [curl](http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) – for integrations;
* [xml](http://php.net/manual/en/book.xml.php) – for excel export;
* [xmlwriter](http://php.net/manual/en/book.xmlwriter.php) – for excel export;
* [exif](http://php.net/manual/en/book.exif.php) – for a proper oriantion of uploaded images.

php.ini settings:

```
max_execution_time = 180
max_input_time = 180
memory_limit = 256M
post_max_size = 50M
upload_max_filesize = 50M
```

Optional php extensions that may be needed:

* [zmq](http://php.net/manual/en/book.zmq.php) – for websocket;
* [pcntl](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pcntl.php) – for parallel job processing and daemon (Unix-like systems only);
* [posix](http://php.net/manual/en/book.posix.php) – for Unix-like systems;
* [ldap](http://php.net/manual/en/book.ldap.php) - for LDAP authentication.


### Database requirements

EspoCRM supports MySQL 5.7 or greater and MariaDB 10.1 or greater. These are no special peculiarities. All default settings are fine for EspoCRM.

### MySQL 8 support

MySQL 8.0.4 has changed a default authentication method to `caching_sha2_password` which is not supported by PHP (at the time of writing). For MySQL 8 it should be changed to `mysql_native_password` method. For a user it can be done with the query:

```
CREATE USER username@localhost identified with mysql_native_password by 'password';
```
where username is your MySQL user, password is your MySQL user password.

## Required permissions for Unix-based systems

**Note**: In most cases permissions are set properly after extracting EspoCRM instance from a zip package. You need only to set ownership.

### Permissions

The files and directories should have the following permissions:

* `/data`, `/custom`, `/client/custom` – should be writable all files, directories and subdirectories (664 for files, 775 for directories, including all subdirectories and files);
* `/application/Espo/Modules`, `/client/modules` – should be writable the current directory (775 for the current directory, 644 for files, 755 for directories and subdirectories);
* all other files and directories should be readable (644 for files, 755 for directories).

To set the permissions, execute these commands in the terminal:

```
cd <PATH-TO-ESPOCRM-DIRECTORY>
find . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} + && find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} +;
find data custom client/custom -type d -exec chmod 775 {} + && find data custom client/custom -type f -exec chmod 664 {} +;
chmod 775 application/Espo/Modules client/modules;
```

### Ownership

All files should be owned and group-owned by the webserver process. It can be *www-data*, *daemon*, *apache*, *www*, etc.

Note: On Bitnami Stack, files should be owned and group-owned by *daemon* user.

Note: On shared hosts, files should be owned and group-owned by your user account.

To set the owner and group-owner, execute these commands in the terminal:

```
cd <PATH-TO-ESPOCRM-DIRECTORY>
chown -R <OWNER>:<GROUP-OWNER> .;
```

## Setting up crontab

Note: More information about jobs in EspoCRM is available [here](jobs.md).

### Unix-like systems

To setup crontab on Unix-like system, take the following steps:

1\. Login as administrator into your EspoCRM instance.

2\. Go to the Scheduled Jobs section in the administrator panel (Menu > Administration > Scheduled Jobs) and copy the string for the crontab. It looks like this one:

```
* * * * * /usr/bin/php -f /var/www/html/espocrm/cron.php > /dev/null 2>&1
```

3\. Open a terminal and run this command:

```
crontab -e -u WEBSERVER_USER
```

WEBSERVER_USER can be one of the following “www”, “www-data”, “apache”, etc (depends on your webserver).

4\. Paste the copied string (from step 2) and save the crontab file (Ctrl+O, then Ctrl+X for nano editor).

### Windows

For Windows servers you can utilize Scheduled Tasks.
