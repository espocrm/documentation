## CLI commands

```
php command.php extension --file="path/to/extension/package.zip"
```

See more [commands](commands.md#extension).

    In some cases, installing extensions via CLI is preferable, as usually PHP configuration for CLI is not as limited as for a web server.
    Hence, such tasks as database index creation are handled better.
