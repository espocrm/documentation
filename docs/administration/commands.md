# Console Commands

!!! note

    You can run `php command.php` instead of `bin/command`. May be reasonable if there's no execute permission for *bin/command*. To grant execute permission run `chmod +x bin/command`.

## List of available commands

```
bin/command
```

## Clear cache

```
php clear_cache.php
```

## Rebuild

```
php rebuild.php
```

Clears cache, rebuilds database and other things.

### Hard rebuild

*As of v7.4.*

```
bin/command rebuild --hard
```

Hard database rebuild. It will drop unused columns, decrease exceeding column lengths, fix index names, set proper collations. It won't drop unused tables (consider removing them manually).

Recommended to have a database backup before running hard rebuild.

## Changing user password

```
bin/command set-password [username]
```

Where `[username]` is a user name, e.g. `admin`.

## Upgrade

```
bin/command upgrade
```

Upgrades EspoCRM instance to the next available version. The upgrade package is downloaded automatically. It may take a few steps to upgrade to the latest version, so you will need to run the same command multiple times.

See additional parameters [here](upgrading.md#additional-parameters).

## Extension

Installing or upgrading:

```
bin/command extension --file="path/to/extension/package.zip"
```

Uninstalling:

```
bin/command extension -u --name="Extension Name"
```

Uninstalling by ID:

```
bin/command extension -u --id="extension-ID"
```

List all extensions:

```
bin/command extension -l
```

## Running job

```
bin/command run-job JobName
```

Where *JobName* is an internal name of the job you want to run.

!!! example

    ```
    bin/command run-job Cleanup
    bin/command run-job ProcessMassEmail
    ```

## Version

Print the current version:

```
bin/command version
```

## Setting user password

```
bin/command set-password {username}
```

Where `{username}` is a user name, e.g. `admin`.

## Creating admin user

*As of v7.4.*

```
bin/command create-admin-user {username}
```

Where `{username}` is a user name, e.g. `admin`.

Can be useful when you need to run an Espo instance from a repository without the need to go through UI installation.

## Import

See more detail [here](import.md#console-commands).

## App info

```
bin/command app-info
```

With this command you can get some information about the application (container services, binding, jobs).

## Update app timestamp

*As of v8.1.*

```
bin/command update-app-timestamp
```

Updates the app timestamp to the current time. When an Espo instance is updated or an extension is installed or uninstalled, the app timestamp is updated to let the browser know that the old cache is not actual anymore. Sometimes developers may need to update the app timestamp manually, for example, when writing custom JavaScript code.

## Rebuild category paths

```
bin/command rebuild-category-paths {EntityType}
```

Rebuilds category paths. For example, for DocumentFolder, WorkflowCategory. May be needed if for some reason paths data is corrupted resulting in not working expanded mode.
