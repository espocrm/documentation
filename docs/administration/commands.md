# Console Commands

!!! note

    As of v7.0 you can run `bin/command` instead of `php command.php`.

## List of available commands

```
php command.php
```

## Clear cache

```
php clear_cache.php
```

## Rebuild

```
php rebuild.php
```

Clears cache, rebuilds database.

### Hard rebuild

*As of v7.4.*

```
php command.php rebuild --hard
```

Hard database rebuild. It will drop unused columns, decrease exceeding column lengths, fix index names, set proper collations. It won't drop unused tables (consider removing them manually).

Recommended to have a database backup before running hard rebuild.


## Changing user password

```
php command.php set-password [username]
```

where `[username]` is a user name, e.g. `admin`.

## Upgrade

```
php command.php upgrade
```

Upgrades EspoCRM instance to the next available version. The upgrade package is downloaded automatically. It may take a few steps to upgrade to the latest version, so you will need to run the same command a few times.

See additional parameters [here](upgrading.md#additional-parameters).

## Extension

```
php command.php extension --file="path/to/extension/package.zip"
```

Uninstalling:

    php command.php run-job ProcessMassEmail
    ```

## Version

```
php command.php version

```

where `{username}` is a user name, e.g. `admin`.

## Creating admin user
