# Backup and Restore

## How to back up EspoCRM manually

To make a full backup of your EspoCRM instance you need to copy EspoCRM files and dump the database. Here are the instructions on how to do it on an Ubuntu server with MySQL or MariaDB.

### Step 1. Back up files

Create an archive of the directory contents of the EspoCRM instance. The default path for Ubuntu is `/var/www/html`. You can use this command:

```bash
tar -czf "files.tar.gz" -C /var/www/html .
```

### Step 2. Back up database

To back up all your data, you have to know the database name and credentials for access. You can find the database name in the configuration file `/ESPOCRM_DIRECTORY/data/config-internal.php` under the section *database*. You can use this command to back up your database:

```bash
mysqldump --user=YOUR_USER --password=YOUR_PASSWORD YOUR_DATABASE_NAME > "db.sql"
```

### Step 3. Copy the backup

That's all. Now, you have to copy the created backup to a safe place.


## How to back up EspoCRM with a script

You can use a script to back up all needed data. Log in via SSH and run the commands (tested on the Ubuntu server).

### Download a script

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espocrm/documentation/stable/docs/_static/scripts/backup.sh
```

### Run the script

```bash
bash ./backup.sh PATH_TO_ESPOCRM BACKUP_PATH
```

where

 * `PATH_TO_ESPOCRM` is a path to installed EspoCRM directory
 * `BACKUP_PATH` is a path to backup directory

For Ubuntu server it is:

```bash
bash ./backup.sh /var/www/html /opt/backups
```

Note: If your MySQL user doesn't have needed rights to dump your database, you will be prompted to enter credentials of another MySQL user.

After successful creation, you will get a path to the created backup.

## Restore EspoCRM from a backup

You can restore the EspoCRM instance from the backup created as described above.

### Step 1. Unarchive backup files

To unarchive files, you can use *Archive Manager* or run the below command. Files need to be placed in the web-server directory.

```bash
tar -xzf "files.tar.gz" -C /var/www/html
```

where `/var/www/html` is the web-server directory.

### Step 2. Set required permissions

The files should be owned by the web-server user and have correct permissions. Set required permissions by following this [instruction](server-configuration.md#required-permissions-for-unix-based-systems).

### Step 3. Import database dump

Database dump should be imported to the same database with the same user credentials, otherwise the correction should be made in the configuration file `ESPOCRM_DIRECTORY/data/config-internal.php`. To import your database from the dump, run the command below in a terminal:

```bash
mysql --user=YOUR_DATABASE_USER --password=YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD YOUR_DATABASE_NAME < db.sql
```

### Step 4. Check/configure crontab

Check if your crontab is configured properly. Run the command below and check if the path to EspoCRM instance is correct:

```bash
sudo crontab -l -u www-data
```

where `www-data` is your web-server user.

If you have to make any changes, use this command:

```bash
sudo crontab -l -u www-data
```

More details about configuring crontab see [here](server-configuration.md#setting-up-crontab).
