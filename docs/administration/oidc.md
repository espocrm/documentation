# OpenID Connect (OIDC) Authentication

*As of v7.3.*

EspoCRM supports authentication over OIDC protocol. A user can log in to multiple systems (your business uses) with a single account. In other words, users can authenticate to Espo with identity providers that support OpenID Connect.

!!! note

    EspoCRM cannot be used as an identity provider. This article is about configuring EspoCRM to use a 3rd party identity provider for authentication.

Additional features:

* User creation. Optional.
* Team mapping. Espo teams against groups/teams/roles of the identity provider.
* User profile and user teams sync. Optional, on every login.
* The ability to choose a claim that will be used for a username.
* Fallback login method. The ability to use the default Espo method. Can be enabled for admins or for both regular users and admins.
* For admins, the OIDC method can be disabled, so that only the fallback method is allowed.
* Logout redirect. To clear an identity provider session when a user is logging out from Espo.
* Backchannel logout. The ability to forcibly log out a user from Espo. `api/v1/backchannelLogout` endpoint.

Details:

* Espo 2FA likely won't work with OIDC (if your identity provider does not allow an authorization code to be used twice; as the Espo authentication process is stateless, it will use the same authorization code for the second step). Consider using 2FA of your identity provider.
* The *userName* field length may need to be increased up to 255 in some cases (by default, Espo has the limit 50).
* Supported signing algorithms: RS256, RS384. RS512, HS256, HS384, HS512. Developers can add implementations of other algorithms in an upgrade-safe manner.
* *client_secret_jwt* and *private_key_jwt* [methods](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication) are not supported. You might need to enable *client_secret_post* method for providers that apply a JWT method by default (e.g. Keycloak).

## Setting up

1. Create an application in your identity provider.
2. In EspoCRM at Administration > Authentication, select the *OIDC* method. Below, on the same form, a *OIDC* panel will appear.
  * Copy the *Client ID* and the *Client Secret* from the identity provider to Espo.
  * Copy the *Authorization Redirect URI* from Espo and add it to a corresponding field on the identity provider.
  * Copy required endpoints (URLs) from the identity provider to Espo.
  * Save the form in Espo.

## Team mapping

If your identity provider users have groups (roles or teams, depending on how your provider names it), it's reasonable to map them against Espo teams. When an Espo user is created (upon signing in first time) or synced, corresponding teams will be assigned to that user according to the configured team mapping.

You need to specify the *Group Claim*, the [claim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) that will be carrying the information about user groups. Some identity providers don't include the group claim in the JWT payload by default and you need to do some settings to have it.

## Setting up for portals

*As of v7.4.*

1. Create an application in your identity provider.
2. In EspoCRM, at Administration > Authentication Providers, create a provider.
3. In EspoCRM, edit the Portal record, select the Authentication Provider.

## Auth0

1. Set the *Group Claim* to `http://www.myexample.com/roles` in Espo.
2. Create [a rule](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/access-control/sample-use-cases-actions-with-authorization?_ga=2.226983773.1572279349.1664444295-1913114833.1664024344&_gl=1*1y6ck81*rollup_ga*MTkxMzExNDgzMy4xNjY0MDI0MzQ0*rollup_ga_F1G3E656YZ*MTY2NDQ1ODY2Mi44LjEuMTY2NDQ2MzU5OS40OS4wLjA.#add-user-roles-to-tokens) to include the roles claim in the JWT.

## Debugging

Set the *DEBUG* or *INFO* mode for the [log](log.md). More information will be printed to the log. It can be useful to see what values is sent in JWT tokens (printed to the log), especially when configuring the team mapping.

## Additional config parameters

Can be set manually in `data/config.php`.

* oidcAuthorizationMaxAge – integer;
* oidcJwksCachePeriod – string  (default: `'10 minutes'`);
* oidcAuthorizationPrompt –  `'none'` | `'consent'` | `'login'` | `'select_account'` (default: `'consent'`); available from the UI as of v8.3.
