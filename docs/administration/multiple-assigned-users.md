# Multiple Assigned Users

*As of v9.0.*

Multiple assigned users can be enabled for custom entity types and for certain built-in entity types. Enable it at: Administration > Entity Manager > {Entity Type} > Edit > check *Multiple Assigned Users* and save.

!!! important

    Existing assigned users which are already set in the *Assigned User* field won't be transferred to the new *Assigned Users* field after enabling multiple assigned users.

The maximum number of assigned users allowed per record can be set at: Administration > Entity Manager > {Entity Type} > Fields > Assigned Users > Max Item Count. By default, it's set to 10.
