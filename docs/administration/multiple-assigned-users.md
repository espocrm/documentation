# Multiple Assigned Users

Note: This is an experimental feature. Flawless work and compatibility with other features are not guaranteed.

Out-of-the-box EspoCRM allows to assign only one user to a certain record. It's possible to add the ability to assign multiple users for a specific entity type.

For this you just need to create a many-to-many relationship between the needed entity type and the *User* entity type, with the name *assignedUsers*. Link Multiple Field must be checked.

Make sure that you chose link names that do not already exist in the system.

Make sure that the old *Assigned User* field is not set as required (at Entity Manager > fields). Make it not required if it is.
