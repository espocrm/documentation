## Integration

Go to the Administration > Integrations > Outlook. Check *Enabled* checkbox.

* You will obtain *Client ID* and *Client Secret* in Azure Active Directory admin center.
* You will need to copy *Redirect URI* to Azure Active Directory admin center.

**1\.** Go to [aad.portal.azure.com](https://aad.portal.azure.com).

**2\.** Create an application.

Follow Azure Active Directory > App registration > Register an application.

Select needed *Supported account types*.

Copy *Redirect URI* from EspoCRM. Note, that type should be set to `Web`.

If the *Never* option is not available, choose *In 2 years*. In this case you will need to re-generate the secret in 2 years.

**5\.** Save Outlook integration credentials in EspoCRM.

**6\.** Grant required permissions for Azure app.

!!! note

    This step is required for Office365 users. For Outlook, it usually works without this step, but it might be needed either.

Click *Api Permissions* on the left panel. Click *Add a permission*. Click *Microsoft Graph*. Click *Delegated permissions*. Then, use search to find the needed permissions and enable them.

Permissions that need to be enabled:

* offline_access – mandatory;
* Calendars.ReadWrite – optional – for calendar sync;
* Contacts.ReadWrite – optional – for contacts pushing;
* IMAP.AccessAsUser.All – optional – for email fetching;
* SMTP.Send – optional – for email sending.

After adding the above listed API permissions, click Grant Admin Consent for (your organization).


## Access control

**Important**: By default, the regular users don’t have access to Outlook Calendar integration. Administrator needs to enable access in Roles. The following scopes need to be enabled:

* External Accounts;
* Outlook Calendar;
* Outlook Contacts.

## Sync scheduling

Sync is run by the scheduled job *Outlook Calendar Sync*. By default, it is executed every 10 minutes. You can change scheduling at Administration > Scheduled Jobs > Outlook Calendar Sync.

## Troubleshooting

Check whether the scheduled job is running Administration > Scheduled Jobs > Outlook Calendar Sync > Log.

Check EspoCRM log at `data/logs` directory. You can also set the [log mode](../../administration/troubleshooting.md#enabling-debug-mode-for-a-logger) to `DEBUG` level to obtain more info from the log.

## Office 365 configuration

### Enabling SMTP

For Office 365 you might need to enable SMTP AUTH for specific mailboxes. See how to do it in the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/authenticated-client-smtp-submission#use-the-microsoft-365-admin-center-to-enable-or-disable-smtp-auth-on-specific-mailboxes).
