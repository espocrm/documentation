# Outlook Integration. Email

!!! note

    Before proceeding to this article it's recommended to [set up the integration](setting-up.md).

OAuth IMAP and SMTP authentication is available in the [Outlook Integration](https://www.espocrm.com/extensions/outlook-integration) extension. It provides a secure authentication for Microsoft 365 and Outlook.com accounts. With this extension, you wonâ€™t need to store your Outlook password in EspoCRM.

In this article, both Microsoft 365 and Outlook.com will be referred to as *Outlook*.

## Setting-up email account

Assuming that the administrator has already set up the Outlook integration.

Create a Personal or Group Email Account. The the you create, specify IMAP and SMTP parameters for Outlook. IMAP host: `outlook.office365.com` or `imap-mail.outlook.com`;  SMTP host: `smtp.office365.com`. Leave the *Password* fields empty for both IMAP and SMTP. Then, save the record.

After that, the *Outlook* panel should appear on the right. You need to click *Connect* button. A popup will show up asking for a user consent.

!!! note

    You need to be logged in to Outlook as a user to which an email address of the current email account record belongs. For example, if you configure an email account for *example@outlook.com*, you need to log in to Outlook as a user who has *example@outlook.com* email address.

After that, you can test IMAP connection and sent a test email to make sure everything works fine.

!!! note

    If during IMAP testing STARTTLS doesn't work, try the SSL/TLS option.
