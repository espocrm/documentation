# Outlook Integration. Email

**Note**: Before proceeding to this article it's recommended to [set up the integration](setting-up.md).

Oauth authentication is available in [Outlook Integration](https://www.espocrm.com/extensions/outlook-integration) extension. It provides a secure authentication for Office 365 accounts. With this extension, you wonâ€™t need to store your Outlook password in EspoCRM.

For Office 365 accounts using the integration is the only option to receive and send emails.

Note: Requires EspoCRM v5.9.3 or later.

## Setting-up email account

Assuming, that the administrator has already set up the integration.

Create a personal or group email account. Specify IMAP and SMTP parameters for Office 365 (hosts: `outlook.office365.com` & `smtp.office365.com`). Leave *Password* fields empty. Then, save the record.

After that, *Outlook* panel should appear on the right. You need to click *Connect* button. A popup will show up asking for a user consent.

Note: You need to be logged in to Outlook as a user to which an email address of the current email account record belongs. For example, if you configure email account for *example@outlook.com*, you need to log in to Outlook as a user who has *example@outlook.com* email address.

After that, you can test imap connection and sent test email to make sure everything works fine.

If during IMAP testing, TLS doesn't work, try the SSL option.

## Recommendations

Important: when connecting to Outlook using the Outlook Integration extension and pressing *Connect* button, you must be asked to enter your credentials fully. This must be done if you did not enter the email address and password in the pop-up window earlier, because if you did, then in the pop-up window you will have the option to select email accounts. If the system just connects you without asking anything, then it's most likely the browser is using the stored values in cookies which allow connection, but may not allow access to the required scope.

There are some recommendations for setting up an email account if you encounter errors when connecting to SMTP.

1. Ensure you are not signed into `office.com`.
2. Clear cookies and other site data.
3. Go to email account and connect to Outlook.
4. Click Test Connection button, check if successful.
6. Click Send Test Email button, check if successful.
