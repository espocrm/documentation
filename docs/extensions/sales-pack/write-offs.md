# Write-offs

*As of Sales Pack v4.0.*

Write-offs allow settling an outstanding balance without receiving or issuing a payment. They are commonly used for minor discrepancies, rounding differences, or amounts deemed uncollectible.

Write-offs are allocated to invoices the same way as payments or credit notes.

Access to Write-offs is controlled by Roles.

Write-offs are available at: Invoices tab > top-right menu > Write-offs. Or you can use the global search for quick access. An administrator can add the Write-offs tab to the navbar.

You can create a write-off for an invoice from the invoice detail view, from the top-right menu. The outstanding amount will be pre-filled in the write-off's amount field.
