# Receipt Orders

*As of Sales Pack v2.0.*

Receipt Orders are used to document product received from suppliers or returned customers.

If the Warehouses feature is enabled, every Receipt Order record should be associated with a Warehouse.

Multiple Receipt Orders can be created from a single [Purchase Order](purchase-orders.md). It may be reasonable when the receipt is split into parts or shipped to different warehouses. The Purchase Order should have status *Released* or *Complete* to be able to create a Receipt Order from it.

Receipt Orders can be created from a [Return Order](return-orders.md).

The following Receipt Order statuses are available:

* Draft;
* Ready;
* Completed â€“ inventory is added to stock;
* Canceled.

It's possible to lock a Receipt Order. Locking disables the ability to change the status and items.

Access to Receipt Orders is controlled by Roles.

It's possible to print a Receipt Order to PDF and send the PDF in an email.

When a Receipt Order contains products that are tracked by Batch or Serial numbers, to be able complete the order, one needs to specify numbers for those products.

It's possible to import Serial numbers from a CSV file within a Receipt Order.
