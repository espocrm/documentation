# Select Builder

Available as of v7.0.0.

The Select Builder builds select queries for the ORM. It applies search parameters (passed from the frontend), access control restrictions, text filters, bool filters, primary filters. It's utilized as a layer over the ORM, since the ORM does not know anything about access control, predefined filters. It does not know how to handle text filters. As well as it does not understand the format of search parameters passed from the frontend.

See all available methods in the class `Espo\Core\Select\SelectBuilder`.

Usage example (building a query):

```php
$selectBuilder = $this->selectBuilderFactory->create();

$query = $selectBuilder
    ->from($entityType)
    ->withStrictAccessControl() // applies ACL
    ->withSearchParams($searchParams) // search parameters passed from the frontend
    ->build();

$collection = $this->entityManager
    ->getRDBRepository($entityType)
    ->clone($query)
    ->find();
```

Usage example (building a query builder):

```php
$query = $selectBuilder
    ->from($entityType)
    ->withPrimaryFilter($primaryFilter)
    ->buildQueryBuilder() // to continue building by means of ORM
    ->where([
        'someAttribute' => $someValue,
    ])
    ->build();
```

Usage example (another user):

```php
$query = $selectBuilder
    ->from($entityType)
    ->forUser($user) // to apply access control for another user
    ->withStrictAccessControl()
    ->build();
```

In your class you need to require `Espo\Core\Select\SelectBuilderFactory` as a dependency.

```php
<?php
namespace Espo\Custom\SomeNamespace;

use Espo\Core\Select\SelectBuilderFactory;

class SomeClass
{
    private $selectBuilderFactory;
    
    public function __construct(SelectBuilderFactory $selectBuilderFactory)
    {
        $this->selectBuilderFactory = $selectBuilderFactory
    }
}
```

Once you built a query you can pass it to the repository:

```php
$collection = $entityManager
    ->getRDBRepository($entityType)
    ->clone($query)
    ->find();
```

Or you can pass it to the QueryExecutor:

```php
$sth = $entityManager->getQueryExecutor()->execute($query);
```
