# Entities

Entities are models that represent the data in your application. Fields are properties of the model that get stored in the database. 

By default, EspoCRM supports the following Entities:

- [Base Entity](../entity/entity-base)
- [Entity Plus](../entity/entity-plus) - An Entity that includes Activities, Tasks, and History by default.
- [Event Entity](../entity/entity-event) - An Entity that has calendar properties, by default
- [Person Entity](../entity/entity-person) - An Entity with details for a person, including an attribute to manage personal data.
- [Company Entity](../entity/entity-company) - An Entity with details for a company or organization.
