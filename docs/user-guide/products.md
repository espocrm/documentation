# Products

The Products feature is available in [Sales Pack](https://www.espocrm.com/extensions/sales-pack/).

Products can be added as line items in Opportunities, Quotes, Sales Orders, Invoices, Delivery Orders, Receipt Orders, Purchase Orders.

The *Product* entity type is available for customization in the Entity Manager. You can add custom fields to the Product as well as custom relationships between the Product and other entity types.

A product record has three price fields: *Cost*, *List* and *Unit*. There is the ability to automatically calculate the *Unit Price* using different formulas according to a selected *Pricing Type*.

Product fields can be printed in a PDF. More detail [here](quotes.md#templates).

Products can be added as line items in an Opportunity. By default, this feature is disabled. The Administrator needs to add the *Items* panel at Administration > Entity Manager > Opportunity > Layouts > Bottom panels.

In this article:

* [Categories](#categories)
* [Variants](#variants)
* [Properties](#properties)

## Categories

Each product record can belong to some product category. Product Categories are presented as a hierarchical tree structure. Each category can have sub-categories.

The Product Category is a separate entity type, hence the access to it is controlled by Roles.

## Variants

*As of Sales Pack v2.0.*

### Product Attributes

Before being able to create products with variants, you need to create some product attributes. Product Attributes are available at Products > the top-right menu > Product Attributes.

Every product attribute is supposed to have a specific set of options. You can add options from the Product Attribute detail view.

Examples of attributes with their options:

* Size – XS, S, M, L, XL
* Color – Red, Blue, White, Black

### Template Products

A template product serves as a root for variants. Product variants inherit properties of its template, some properties can be overridden in variants.

To create a product with variants you need to create a Template product. Click **Create Product** from the **Products** page, select *Template* **Type**. Then, in the **Template** tab, add needed attributes. For every attribute, select options needed options. Then **Save** the product.

After that, you need to generate variants. From the template product detail view, open the **Variants** tab in the bottom, click **Generate**. It will generate all possible combinations according to attributes and options of the product template.

You can remove variants that you don't need. E.g. a Red shirt is not produced in XS size, hence, you need to remove the XS-Red variant.

You can re-generate variants. It will create all missing combinations.

!!! important

    Once a product variant is references somewhere in the system (e.g. in a sales order), you should not remove that variant. Otherwise, after you re-generate it, it will be a different product record with a different ID.

    For the same reason, it's not recommended to add additional attributes to product templates, variants of which are already referenced.

### Misc

When you select a template product (e.g. in a Quote), a modal dialog will appear prompting to select a specific variant.

Inventory quantity is tracked on the variant level. When viewing the quantity of a Template product, the sum of all variants will be shown.

An Inventory Number cannot be associated with a Product Template. It should be associated with a specific Variant.

It's possible to specify Product fields that should be **synced** between Template and Variants. Administration > Entity Manager > Products > Edit > Variant sync fields. These fields will be read-only in Variants. Whenever a field value is changed in a Template, it will be automatically copied to Variants. By default, the *Status* field is selected as synced.

## Properties

### Allow Fractional Quantity

If enabled, it will be possible to use fractional quantity values for a product.

### Is Inventory

Actual if the *Inventory Transactions* feature is enabled in the system. If the *Is Inventory* parameter is disabled in a product, its quantity won't be tracked. Can be reasonable for service products.

### Inventory Number Type

Can be empty, Batch or Serial. See more about inventory numbers [here](../extensions/sales-pack/inventory-management.md#inventory-numbers).

### Removal strategy

Available if *Inventory Number Type* is not empty. Determines how Inventory Numbers will be sorted when a user picks a number for a delivery or transfer order.

Available options:

* FIFO – first in, first out; sorted by *Incoming Date* in ascending order;
* FEFO – first expired, first out; sorted by *Expiration Date* in ascending order;
* LIFO – last in, first out; sorted by *Incoming Date* in descending order.

### Expiration Days

Available if *Inventory Number Type* is not empty. A number of days that is automatically added to the current date to determine an *Expiration Date* of an Inventory Number when the number is created in the system. Note that the Expiration Date then can be changed by a user.

### Tax-free

The product can be marked as *Tax-free*. It will prevent applying the tax rate upon adding the product to a quote, sales order or invoice.
