# Products

The Products feature is available in the [Sales Pack](https://www.espocrm.com/extensions/sales-pack/) extension.

Products can be added as line items in Opportunities, Quotes, Sales Orders, Invoices, Delivery Orders, Receipt Orders, and Purchase Orders.

The *Product* entity type is available for customization in the Entity Manager. You can add custom fields to the Product as well as custom relationships between the Product and other entity types.

A product record has 3 price fields: *Cost*, *List* and *Unit*. There is the ability to automatically calculate the *Unit Price* using different formulas according to a selected *Pricing Type*. Prices can also be defined in Price Books.

Products can be associated with tax classes. This enables automated tax application based on defined tax rules.

With the Inventory Management feature enabled, you can track the availability of each product item.

Products can be printed to PDF. See more detail [here](quotes.md#templates).

The ability to add products as line items of an Opportunity is disabled by default. The Administrator needs to add the *Items* panel under Administration > Entity Manager > Opportunity > Layouts > Bottom panels.

* [Categories](#categories)
* [Variants](#variants)
* [Properties](#properties)

## Categories

Each product can be linked to a category. Categories can be arranged in a hierarchical tree structure, where each category may include subcategories.

The Product Category is a separate entity type. Access to it is controlled by Roles.

## Variants

*As of Sales Pack v2.0.*

### Product Attributes

Before being able to create products with variants, you need to create some Product Attributes. Product attributes are available under: Products > the top-right menu > Product Attributes.

Every product attribute is supposed to have a specific set of options. Add needed options on the Product Attribute detail view.

Examples of attributes with their options:

* Size – XS, S, M, L, XL
* Color – Red, Blue, White, Black

### Template Products

A Template Product serves as a root for variants. Product variants inherit properties of its template, some properties can be overridden in variants.

To create a product with variants you need to create a template product. Click **Create Product** from the **Products** page, select *Template* **Type**. Then, in the **Template** tab, add needed attributes. For every attribute, select options needed options. Then **Save** the Product.

After that, you need to generate variants. From the template product detail view, open the **Variants** tab in the bottom, click **Generate**. It will generate all possible combinations according to attributes and options of the product template.

You can remove variants that you don't need. E.g. a Red shirt is not produced in the XS size, hence, you need to remove the XS-Red variant.

You can re-generate variants. It will create all missing combinations.

!!! important

    Once a product variant is references somewhere in the system (e.g. in a sales order), you should not remove that variant. Otherwise, after you re-generate it, it will be a different product record with a different ID.

    For the same reason, it's not recommended to add additional attributes to product templates, variants of which are already referenced.

### Misc

When you select a template product (e.g. in a Quote), a modal dialog will appear prompting to select a specific variant.

Inventory quantity is tracked on the variant level. When viewing the quantity of a Template product, the sum of all variants will be shown.

An Inventory Number cannot be associated with a Product Template. It should be associated with a specific Variant.

It's possible to specify Product fields that should be **synced** between Template and Variants. Administration > Entity Manager > Products > Edit > Variant sync fields. These fields will be read-only in Variants. Whenever a field value is changed in a Template, it will be automatically copied to Variants. By default, the *Status* field is selected as synced.

## Properties

### Allow Fractional Quantity

If enabled, it will be possible to use fractional quantity values for a product.

### Is Inventory

Actual if the *Inventory Transactions* feature is enabled in the system. If the *Is Inventory* parameter is disabled in a product, its quantity won't be tracked. Can be reasonable for service products.

### Inventory Number Type

Can be empty, Batch or Serial. See more about inventory numbers [here](../extensions/sales-pack/inventory-management.md#inventory-numbers).

### Removal strategy

Available options:

* FIFO – first in, first out; sorted by *Incoming Date* in ascending order;
* FEFO – first expired, first out; sorted by *Expiration Date* in ascending order;
* LIFO – last in, first out; sorted by *Incoming Date* in descending order.

### Expiration Days

Available if *Inventory Number Type* is not empty. A number of days that is automatically added to the current date to determine an *Expiration Date* of an Inventory Number when the number is created in the system. Note that the Expiration Date then can be changed by a user.

### Tax-free

The product can be marked as *Tax-free*. It will prevent applying the tax rate upon adding the product to a quote, sales order or invoice.
