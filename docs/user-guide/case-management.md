## Overview

Cases provide the issue tracking ability. It's a principal aspect of customer service in EspoCRM. 'Ticket' term also can be used for cases.

The Case entity can be associated with one Account and/or with multiple Contacts.

New cases are supposed to be created by the following scenarios:

* Manually by CRM users
* Manually by users of the customer portal
* Through the API (e.g. through the web form)
* Automatically when a new email came to a specific mailbox
* Automatically by a Workflow rule

When the new case is created by a portal user it's not assigned to any user. By utilizing [Workflows](../administration/workflows.md) administrator can create rule that will notify certain users about a new case in the system. Workflows also provide an ability to apply assignment rule to new cases, i.e. *Round-Robin* and *Least-Busy* rules. For more complex business flows it's recommended to utilize [BPM tool](../administration/bpm.md).

To prevent overlooking of new cases, users can add Case entity type to the *Global Auto-follow* list at Preferences. Then they will automatically follow every new case.

Note: If there is no portal user associated with a linked contact, then the customer won't receive email notifications about updates in the Stream. You need to use emails for communication with the customer.

## Stream

Case record has a stream that can be utilized for a communication between customer and service.

CRM users can make *internal posts* that won't be visible in a customer portal. For this, you need to click the lock icon next to *Post* button.

## Email-to-Case

Administrator can set up Group Email Account that will create a new case on each new inbound email. For more information [see here](../administration/emails.md).

Users can create a case from an email manaully. On the email detail view click the dropdown in the top-right corner, then *Create Case*.

When a user want to send a reply to the customer, they need to make sure that the case is selected as a *Parent* of the email that is being sent. It will add the group email address to *Reply-To* field of the email. So the customer's reply will be sent to the group address rather than to the userâ€™s one.

## Knowledge Base

Users can relate knowledge base articles to the case record. See more info about knowledge base [here](knowledge-base.md).

## Customer Portal

Administrator can create a [portal](../administration/portal.md) where customers will be able to create cases. Permission to create cases can be granted in a portal role.

Since portal users automatically follow cases they created, they will receive email notifications about new messages in the case's stream.
