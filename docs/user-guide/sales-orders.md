## Total Values Layout

The layout of total value fields (in the bottom on detail view) can be modified at Administration > Layout Manager > Sales Orders > Bottom Total.

## Sales Order Items

A Sales Order has the list of items. Each item can represent a certain product or a service with description, quantity, tax rate, list price, and unit price fields. It's possible to sort items manually.

There is the ability to add custom fields to the Sales Order Item entity type using the Entity Manager.

### Sales Order Items Layout

The layout of Sales Order Items can be modified at Administration > Layout Manager > Sales Order Items > List (Item).

### Discount Rate

It's possible to specify a discount in percents. To have this ability, an administrator should add the *Discount (%)* field to the *List (Item)* layout.

## Printing to PDF

Sales Orders can be printed to PDF. This action is available in the dropdown next to the Edit button on the sales orderâ€™s detail view. Then, you will be prompted to select a template. More info about printing to PDF is available [here](printing-to-pdf.md).

### Templates

See the documentation [for quote templates](quotes.md#templates).

## Sending in email

A Sales Order PDF can be send in an email as an attachment. Open a sales order record, click the dropdown next to the Edit button and then click Email PDF.

To have the Sales Order entity selected as the email's parent, an administrator should add the Sales Order entity type to the parent type list. Administration > Entity Manager > Email > Fields > Parent > Entity List. As of v3.0.

## Automatic numbering

By default, the *Number* field is auto-incremented. You can disable auto-increment at Administration > Entity Manager > Sales Order > Fields > number. It's also possible to make the number field read-only.

The prefix of the next number, the next number itself and the quantity of digits in the number can be configured at Administration > Entity Manager > Sales Order > Fields > numberA.

By default, there is no *Name* field on the *Detail* layout. The *Number* is used as a name. You can add the Number field at Administration > Entity Manager > Sales Order > Layouts > Detail.

## Default tax

To have the default tax, you need to have a Tax record created in your CRM. Taxes can be accessed at: the Quotes list view > dropdown in the top-right corner > Taxes.

An administrator can specify the default Tax record at Administration > Entity Manager > Sales Order > fields > Tax > Default.

## Copying values from product to sales order item

Field values can be transferred from a product to a sales order item upon product selection. Field names you want to be copied should coincide in the Product and the Sales Order Item entity types.

You can select which fields you need to be copied: Administration > Entity Manager > Sales Order Item > Fields > Product > Fields to Copy.

## Locking

A Sales Order can be locked if it's completed or canceled. When a record is locked, a specific fields become read-only. An administrator can configure the field list at: Administration > Entity Manager > Sales Order > Edit.

If the settings parameter *Forbid order unlocking* is checked, once a record is locked, it can be unlocked only by an administrator.
