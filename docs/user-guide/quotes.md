# Quotes

The Quotes feature is available in [Sales Pack](https://www.espocrm.com/extensions/sales-pack/).

A Quote is a specific group of products or services with their quantities and prices that you quote to customers.

Quote has a relationship with Opportunity. You can add the *Quotes* panel to the Opportunity detail view at Administration > Layout Manager > Opportunities > Relationships. When creating a new quote linked to an opportunity it transfers opportunity items to the quote.

You can add the Quotes panel to the Account detail view to be able to see related quotes. At Administration > Layout Manager > Accounts > Relationships.

## Generating Sales Orders and Invoices from Quote

You are able to create Sales Order and Invoice from the existing Quote.

Method 1. Create a new sales order or invoice, on the form specify the needed quote. Data will be copied from the quote to the created sales order or invoice.

## Total Values Layout

The layout of total value fields (in the bottom on detail view) can be modified at Administration > Layout Manager > Quotes > Bottom Total.

## Quote Items

Quote has a list of items. Each item can represent a certain product or a service with description, quantity, tax rate, list price and unit price fields. It's possible to sort items manually.

There is an ability to add custom fields for Quote Item entity using Entity Manager.

### Quote Items Layout

The layout of quote items can be modified at Administration > Layout Manager > Quote Items > List (Item).

### Discount Rate

It's possible to specify a discount in percents. To have this ability, administrator should add 'Discount (%)' field to the List (Item) layout.

## Printing to PDF

Quotes can be printed to PDF. This action is available in the dropdown next to Edit button on the quote’s detail view. Then you will be prompted to select Template. More info about printing to PDF is available [here](printing-to-pdf.md).

### Templates

An example template is available by default. You can create new templates (Quotes list view > top-right dropdown menu > Templates) as well as edit the existing ones.

For more precise editing, it's recommended to use Code View mode.

You can print fields of Quote record as well as fields of related records by utilizing placeholders in your template.

Examples:

`{{accountName}}` – Account name,

`{{{billingAddressStreet}}}` – street,

`{{account.type}}` – type of related Account,

`{{assignedUser.lastName}}` – last name of the assigned user.

If your line item is a product, you can print product’s fields.

Examples:

`{{product.length}}`,

`{{product.color}}`.

The length and color are custom fields of Product entity in examples.

Looping through quote items:

```
<!-- {{#each itemList}} -->
  <td>{{order}}</td>
  <td>{{name}}</td>
  <td>{{quantity}}</td>
  <td>{{product.weight}}</td>
  <td align="right">{{listPrice}}</td>
  <td align="right">{{unitPrice}}</td>
  <td align="right">{{amount}}</td>
<!-- {{/each}} -->
```

It's possible to print image fields:

```
<img src="{{file imageId}}">
```
where `imageId` – the name of custom image field, concatenated with the suffix `Id`.

For product line item:
```
<img src="{{file product.photoId}}">
```

To display float numbers (like quantity, unitPrice etc.) w/o fractional part (as integer), use the following expression:
```
{{numberFormat quantity_RAW decimals=0}}
```

Custom formatting for currency values (since version 4.8.3):
```
{{numberFormat unitPrice_RAW decimals=2 decimalPoint=',' thousandsSeparator=' '}}
```
Value `10000.5` will be printer as `10 000,50`.

To display text fields (multiline), use triple braces: `{{{description}}}`.

#### Quote Items attributes

You can use these attributes in a template inside the loop `{{#each itemList}}`:

* name
* quantity
* listPrice
* unitPrice
* discount
* amount
* unitWeight
* weight
* taxRate
* order
* description

All fields can be found at Administration > Entity Manager > Quote Items > Fields.


## Sending quote in email

Quote PDF can be send in email as an attachment. Open a quote record, click the dropdown next to Edit button and then click Email PDF.

## Automatic numbering

By default, the *Number* field is auto-incremented. You can disable auto-increment at Administration > Entity Manager > Quote > Fields > number. It's also possible to make the number field read-only.

The prefix of the next number, the next number itself and the quantity of digits in the number can be configured at Administration > Entity Manager > Quote > Fields > numberA.

By default, there is no *Name* field on the *Detail* layout. The *Number* is used as a name. You can add the Number field at Administration > Entity Manager > Quote > Layouts > Detail.

## Default tax

You need to have a Tax record created in your CRM. Taxes can be accessed at Quotes list view > dropdown in the top-right corner > Taxes.

Administrator can specify a default Tax record at Administration > Entity Manager > Quote > fields > Tax > Default.

## Copying values from product to quote item

Field values can be transferred from a product to a quote item upon product selection. Field names you want to be copied should coincide in Product and Quote Item entities.

You can select which fields you need to be copied at Administration > Entity Manager > Quote Item > Fields > Product > Fields to Copy.
