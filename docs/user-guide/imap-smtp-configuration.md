## IMAP configuration

    You need to have cron properly configured in your system to have inbound emails working.

IMAP allows to retrieve your emails from an email client. To setup the IMAP account, do the following steps:
1. Select *Emails Tab > top-right menu > Personal Email Accounts*.
2. Click on *Create Personal Email Account*.
3. In the *Main* section, specify your *Email Address*. The *Name* of personal email account is generated automatically, but you may change it. *Fetch since* allows to choose the date from which emails should be archived. In case you want to archive old emails, set it to some prior date to the day from which they should be fetched.

!!! note

    If you have **2FA** enabled for your Microsoft account, you need to create app password and use it in Espo instead of your main password. More info [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-and-two-step-verification).

## Yahoo

Configuration details are available [here](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN4075.html).

## App passwords

For security reasons it's not recommended to use account passwords when connecting to services like email. That's why major services provides the ability to generate a different password that will be used only in a specific application for a single purpose.

See the articles for the service you use:
