## IMAP configuration

Note: You need to have cron properly configured in your system to have inbound emails working.

IMAP allows to retrieve your emails from an email client. To setup the IMAP account, do the following steps:
1. Select **Emails Tab > top-right menu > Personal Email Accounts**.
2. Click on **Create Personal Email Account**.
3. In the **Main** section, specify your **Email Address**. The **Name** of personal email account is generated automatically, but you may change it. **Fetch since** allows to choose the date from which emails should be archived. In case you want to archive old emails, set it to some prior date to the day from which they should be fetched.
