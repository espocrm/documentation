# Maps

## How to show the map based on an address field

Every Address field has its corresponding Map field. All you need is to put it on Detail layout. It uses Google Maps service.

`Administration > Layout Manager > Choose entity (Account, Contact, Lead or custom one) > Detail > Drag & Drop Map field.`

Make the cell wide using the minus sign.

You can also configure the height of your field.

`Administration > Entity Manager > Choose entity > Fields > find the map field and click on it > edit the height and save.`

## Api Key

Since EspoCRM version 4.2.0 you need to specify Api Key to use Google Maps (Administration > Integration > Google Maps).
